# HFRP and firmware IRQ evidence

The auxiliary P16 aperture has a verified Windows HFRP register/interrupt
protocol correspondence with the pinned L4T source. **The physical P16 GSI
assignment is still unverified.** No Linux IRQ is registered by this work, and
the bootstrap still does not map/write the auxiliary aperture. HFRP response
rings, clock/power transitions and recovery are not implemented by the new
capture helper.

## Inputs and boundaries

The Windows input is the existing SHA-pinned NVIDIA 617.42 `nvlddmkm.sys`.
The audited P16 DLA resources are `0x19000000/0x40000` and
`0x31380000/0x10000`, followed by level/high GSIs 463 and 800 in ACPI resource
order. Windows's recovered resource provider names the second MMIO entry
**resource id 2**, not Linux aperture index 1. Do not equate those identifiers.

The local primary GPL reference is under
`sources/linux-nv-oot-r38/drivers/video/tegra/host/nvdla/`:

| Reference file | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `port/pm/nvdla_pm_hfrp_reg.h` | `ca7bc4d365772cedcc09ae08b43cd2f232a581b14c748d9b8642e33b2e3f6e89` |
| `port/pm/nvdla_pm_hfrp.c` | `c518045a2afa20890015cd02f400b2f35d1afd73ba2d926cbfbd41dbae1bc0b8` |
| `port/fw/nvdla_fw_riscv.c` | `86a6e30855388b53636553f6e0128cde6c4c8b18d0bc86a247aa90f16e1c2a05` |

In that source, `nvdla_fw_init` requests IRQ index 0 for `s_riscv_isr`.
`nvdla_pm_init` uses `NVDLA_HFRP_APERTURE_IDX=1` for both the HFRP aperture and
IRQ index, registering `s_hfrp_isr`. This makes GSI 463=firmware and 800=HFRP a
**candidate based on the P16's resource order**, not a measured identity or a
reason to enable either interrupt blindly.

## Original Windows initializer and MMIO chain

Windows initializer RVA `0xd4aeb8`, with its observed constructor argument 0
from `0xd3d988`, sets these class fields. The test compiles the actual pinned
L4T header to obtain independent reference offsets; all eight agree:

| Windows class offset | Register offset | L4T reference role |
|---|---|---|
| `0x20` | `0x110` | client buffer offsets |
| `0x28` | `0x114` | command buffer start |
| `0x30` | `0x188` | server buffer offsets |
| `0x38` | `0x18c` | response buffer start |
| `0x40` | `0x100` | IRQ_IN_SET |
| `0x44` | `0x104` | IRQ_OUT_SET |
| `0x48` | `0x108` | IRQ_IN_CLR |
| `0x4c` | `0x10c` | IRQ_OUT_CLR |

This is a register-layout correspondence, not proof of every queue field or
live HFRP firmware version. The initializer has another argument-dependent
layout; this comparison concerns the observed mode-0 constructor path only.

The original callback chain is also executed, not replaced with a generic
read/write assumption. Class `+8` points at `0xd3d880`, `+0x10` at `0xd3d8d0`,
and `+0x18` points to the provider link. The read wrapper follows that link and
calls `0xd39878(owner, 2, offset, out)`; the write wrapper tail-calls
`0xd39f38(owner, 2, offset, value)`. Thus the HFRP accesses are tied to Windows
resource id 2 rather than to the DLA remapper or SROOT mailbox.

## Original IRQ capture and parent dispatch

The original HFRP capture function `0xd4b308`:

1. Reads IRQ_OUT_SET through class field `+0x44`.
2. Increments a 32-bit counter at class `+0x40e0` when status bit 1 is set,
   including wraparound from UINT32_MAX to zero.
3. Writes the entire observed status to IRQ_OUT_CLR through field `+0x4c`.
4. ORs the raw status into class `+0x40dc` and returns whether it was nonzero.

It even writes zero for a zero status. Its outer wrapper `0xd3dc28` gates access
on the provider's enable field, and records timestamps for bits 26/28/30 and
27/29/31. These agree with the L4T start/end notifications for entering clock, power
and rail gating. An end bit is **not** an exit/wakeup indication. No timestamp
unit is inferred. The wrapper inspects accumulated pending bits: when bit 26
is already pending and bit 27 arrives, the test observes both timestamp slots
rewritten. Do not copy that as a validated latency measurement. The test does
not exercise physical transitions or infer safe power actions.

The parent function `0xd39198` checks HFRP through parent `+0x300` first. If the
enabled HFRP callback reports nonzero status, this invocation skips the primary
DLA probe. Otherwise it calls the primary object's status callback `+0x280`;
a nonzero successful result is accumulated at `+0x4a0` and its `+0xe0` callback
is invoked to schedule subsequent work. A primary accessor error prevents that
accumulation/scheduling. The primary status callback and scheduler are explicit
stubs in this parent-dispatch test; actual primary response handling is tested
separately.

This proves a shared software dispatch path and HFRP-first priority, not which
physical wire invoked it. In particular, simultaneous modeled pending sources
are not both consumed in the same parent call. The eventual Linux IRQ design
must account for this and preserve deferred events instead of dropping them.

A static import-reference scan also found the generic adapter's
`IoConnectInterruptEx` call at RVA `0x1ad1304`, constructing a message-service
callback plus line fallback (`0xe3c5e0` / `0xe3c5f0`). It has **not** been tied to
the NPU PDO or its ACPI IRQ descriptors. Microsoft's API distinguishes
PDO-derived line registration and message registration with fallback; an import
or fallback message index cannot identify the P16's GSI order.

and [line-based registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-the-connect-line-based-version-of-ioconnectinterruptex).

## Minimal C capture component

`driver/n1x_hfrp.c` implements only the status read and raw W1C acknowledgment
against HFRP-relative I/O callbacks. It is not linked into the observation or
bootstrap module, and has no binding, IRQ registration, power operation or
response-ring consumer.

Invalid callback/output arguments cause no I/O and leave the output unchanged.
Afterward result fields preserve read validity, raw status, ACK attempt and ACK
success. A zero status returns EAGAIN without Windows's no-op zero write.
Read/write errors propagate. In particular, an ACK error leaves the captured
status available for recovery, rather than falsely reporting success.

Those differences are deliberate: the original read wrapper ignores its lower
accessor's error and the original capture routine ignores its writer's return.
Synthetic failure controls reproduce both behaviors. Linux must not copy them.
The returned raw status preserves unknown bits and does not mean higher-level
HFRP work has completed. Caller-owned queuing/counter accounting, recovery after
uncertain acknowledgment and DMA lifetime remain responsibilities of a future
IRQ implementation.

## Reproduction and remaining work

```sh
venv/bin/python scripts/test_hfrp_irq.py
make kernel-check
```

The test executes the original initializer, MMIO wrappers, HFRP capture and
parent dispatcher with synthetic OS/MMIO boundaries. It checks eight exact
L4T header offsets, 72 C capture/fault comparisons, 48 parent-dispatch cases with timestamp checks,
Windows swallowed-error controls, primary-error suppression and four C
preflight rejections. Counter/pending state and all original nonzero success
MMIO traces are checked. The C component compiles against current and installed
test-kernel headers; the isolated object build/manifest is in
`results/npu1-hfrp-build/`.

No interrupt was requested, device register read/written, bootstrap loaded or
firmware started by these tests. Hardware GSI routing, HFRP queue processing,
power-state coordination, full initialization and inference remain unverified.
Do not map the auxiliary block, register an IRQ or add power writes solely from
the index analogy. The next evidence should connect the Windows interrupt
registration context to this parent path, or capture actual source status during
an explicitly qualified hardware experiment.
